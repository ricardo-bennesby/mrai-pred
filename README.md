# MRAI-pred Framework

MRAI-pred, to the best of my knowledge, is the first hybrid framework endowed with a learning mechanism that integrates the SDN paradigm within interdomain routing domains to improve the interdomain routing convergence time. This is achieved by  employing the LSTM learning technique that allows the tuning of MRAI value aiming to reduce the convergence time according to learned patterns from collected BGP UPDATE features.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The software tools you should install as a prerequisite to the MRAI-pred Framework:

* [Keras with Tensorflow backend](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/14/installing-keras-with-tensorflow-backend/)
* [ExaBGP](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp)
* [Ryu Controller](https://osrg.github.io/ryu/)
* [Mininet](http://mininet.org/download/)
* [PEERING](https://peering.usc.edu/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be



```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
